## Overview

bagop is a simple build tool for Go which tries to build your app for all platforms supported by Go by default. Instead of manually adding specific `GOOS`es and `GOARCH`es, bagop builds for all valid targets by default, and gives you the choice to disable those which you don't want to support or which can't be supported.

## Installation

Static binaries are also available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/bagop/releases).

On Linux, you can install them like so:

```shell
$ curl -L -o /tmp/bagop "https://github.com/pojntfx/bagop/releases/latest/download/bagop.linux-$(uname -m)"
$ sudo install /tmp/bagop /usr/local/bin
```

On macOS, you can use the following:

```shell
$ curl -L -o /tmp/bagop "https://github.com/pojntfx/bagop/releases/latest/download/bagop.darwin-$(uname -m)"
$ sudo install /tmp/bagop /usr/local/bin
```

On Windows, the following should work (using PowerShell as administrator):

```shell
PS> Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/pojntfx/bagop/releases/latest/download/bagop.windows-x86_64.exe -OutFile \Windows\System32\bagop.exe
```

You can find binaries for more operating systems and architectures on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/bagop/releases).

## Tutorial

Let's assume we have a Go app called `hello-world` and we want to build it for as many platforms as possible using bagop. This is the `main.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

We could now start to manually (cross-)compile by running `go build -o hello-world main.go` and setting `GOOS` or `GOARCH`, or use simplified process with bagop. To build `hello-world` for all Go-supported platforms, simply run:

```shell
$ bagop -b hello-world main.go
2021/07/28 14:34:40 building aix/ppc64 (out/hello-world.aix-ppc64)
2021/07/28 14:34:40 building android/386 (out/hello-world.android-i686)

2021/07/28 14:34:41 building android/arm (out/hello-world.android-armv7l)
2021/07/28 14:34:41 could not build for platform android/arm: err=exit status 2, stdout=, stderr=# command-line-arguments

/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64/link: running gcc failed: exit status 1
gcc: error: unrecognized command line option â€˜-marmâ€™; did you mean â€˜-mabmâ€™?
```

As you can see, we get an error for Android (Android and iOS require additional support). We decide we don't want to support Android (and iOS), so let's re-run the command with these platforms disabled:

```shell
$ bagop -b hello-world -x '(android/*|ios/*|openbsd/mips64)' main.go

```

If we now check the `out` directory, we can see that we now have successfully built binaries for all supported platforms:

```shell
$ file out/*

```

Now, let's add a few compiler flags to make the build binaries fully static; we can do this by using the `-p` flag and manually setting the build command. We'll also set `-j` to allow parallel builds:

```shell
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 bagop -j "$(nproc)" -b hello-world -x '(android/*|ios/*|openbsd/mips64)' -p "go build -a -ldflags '-extldflags \"-static\"' -o \$DST main.go"
2021/07/28 14:36:50 building aix/ppc64 (out/hello-world.aix-ppc64)
2021/07/28 14:36:51 skipping android/386 (platform matched the provided regex)
2021/07/28 14:36:51 skipping android/amd64 (platform matched the provided regex)
2021/07/28 14:36:51 skipping android/arm (platform matched the provided regex)
# ...
```

If we now check the output again, you can see that the binaries are now fully static:

```shell
$  ldd out/hello-world.linux-x86_64
        not a dynamic executable
```

ðŸš€ **That's it!** We've successfully added support for a total of _38_ target platforms to this app.

  -x, --exclude string      Regex of platforms not to build for, i.e. (windows/386|linux/mips64)
  -e, --extra-args string   Extra arguments to pass to the Go compiler
  -g, --goisms              Use Go's conventions (i.e. amd64) instead of uname's conventions (i.e. x86_64)
  -j, --jobs int            Maximum amount of parallel jobs (default 1)
  -p, --plain               Sets GOARCH, GOARCH and DST and leaves the rest up to you (see example usage)
